# haskell-wishlist

A curated wishlist of Haskell libraries, packages, and tools.
Additions welcome via issues or _pull requests_.

## TOC

- [Distributed Systems](#distributed-systems)
- [Machine Learning](#machine-learning)
- [Numeric and Scientific Computing](#numeric-and-scientific-computing)

## Distributed Systems

- Virtual Synchrony
- ~~Raft consensus algorithm~~
  - [kontiki](https://github.com/NicolasT/kontiki)


## Machine Learning

- Incremental algorithms for classification, regression, ranking, or combined regression and ranking (e.g., [sofia-ml](https://code.google.com/p/sofia-ml/))

## Numeric and Scientific Computing

- Data Analysis

  - ggplot2 / R

    Needs a good viz story. Diagrams exists, but something that renders instantly in a quartz window like R would be ideal. Seems to require more schlepping in Haskell right now as well.

  - Side-by-side tutorial of, "How to do this in R" -> " How to do this in Haskell"

- ~~Signal Processing~~
  - [dsp](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dsp)

- ~~Linear Algebra~~
  - [hmatrix](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix)
  - [linear](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear)
