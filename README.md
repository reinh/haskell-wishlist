# haskell-wishlist
A curated wishlist of Haskell libraries, packages, and tools.
Additions welcome via issues or _pull requests_.

## TOC

- [Machine Learning](#machine-learning)
- [Data Analysis](#data-analysis)
- [User Interface](#ui)

## Machine Learning

- Incremental algorithms for classification, regression, ranking, or combined regression and ranking (e.g., [sofia-ml](https://code.google.com/p/sofia-ml/))

## Data Analysis
- IPython-like ghci repl for analysis and authoring

## User Interface
- A Haskell-configurable WM (like, or maybe even actually XMonad) with combined editor, terminal emulator, etc. (for sharing semantics across different applications, splitting a browser window should be no different from splitting a terminal window.)
