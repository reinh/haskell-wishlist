# haskell-wishlist

A curated wishlist of Haskell libraries, packages, and tools.
Additions welcome via issues or _pull requests_.

## Data Analysis

### ggplot2 / R / scipy

- Needs a good viz story. Diagrams exists, but something that renders instantly in a quartz window like R would be ideal. Seems to require more schlepping in Haskell right now as well.

- Side-by-side tutorial of, "How to do this in R" -> " How to do this in Haskell"


## Distributed Systems

- Virtual Synchrony


## Machine Learning

- Incremental algorithms for classification, regression, ranking, or combined regression and ranking (e.g., [sofia-ml](https://code.google.com/p/sofia-ml/))
